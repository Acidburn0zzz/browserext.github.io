</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I haven't had a chance
    to go through the IDs questions yet.<br>
    ... But other than what we have on the call today, that's the
    only thing left, so we'll look into it.<br>
    ... on <a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/15">issue 15</a>, we're past the 10 days after resolution, so we
    can close<br>
    ... <a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/31">Next issue</a>: we had already specified that the object
    returned by webdriver's getBrowserExtension method had an id,
    and I also specified that it should have the name.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> This needs to be
    localized<br>
    ... Not sure which locale to use though.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> This is a setting that
    is often wrong.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> If we want to match the
    browser's UI locale, we need to expose that.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> In some cases you may
    want to match the site rather than the UI.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>scottlow:</b> Since the ID is an
    unpredictable number, you need a name to be able to know which
    extension your talking to.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> If that's what its for,
    it doesn't need localization, it needs predictability.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mike:</b> So we can use the default
    locale.</p>

    <p class="phone"><a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/31#issuecomment-281252511"><strong class="resolution" id="resolution01">RESOLUTION: Add the name property, and define it to be the default locale</strong></a></p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> <a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/46">Issue 46</a>: This is about
    interacting with permission prompts.<br>
    ... I made 3 additions:<br>
    ... the API lets you get the localized text of the permission
    prompt, and based on it accept it or dismiss it.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> I'm worried about text
    matching.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> What options do we
    have?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> We have a permission name
    string, and return that in JSON.<br>
    ... These names are already standard.</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>mikepie</b>&gt; (3) requestingUrl</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I'll replace that string
    with a JSON object, including "requestingUrl"...<br>
    ... Also "permissions".</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Why plural?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> I think there can be
    multiple permissions in one dialog</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Yes, at install time, an
    extension can ask for multiple permission</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>scottlow:</b> are these optional
    permissions?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> In our case, geolocation is
    a bit special, but otherwise yes.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>scottlow:</b> Are these about
    security permissions as well?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> No.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> We will deal with
    run-time permissions with this as well?<br>
    ... What if there's multiple ones queued up</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> You would have to accept or
    dismiss them in the order they are being displayed at. You
    cannot get the list of all queued permissions at once.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Don't we run the risk that this will
    make authors depend on browser specific ordering of the
    permission prompts?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> We do, but that's the
    sanest thing we can do anyway.<br>
    ... This can only happen if requesting multiple permissions at
    the same time.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Yeah, this isn't great,
    as we may get authors to depend on the ordering even though
    they shouldn't, but I cannot think of a better alternative.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I'll add a note to call
    it out.<br>
    ... and the third property is the prompt text</p>

    <p class="phone"><a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/46#issuecomment-281253274"><strong class="resolution" id="resolution02">RESOLUTION: add requestingURL, permissions and
    promptText</strong><br>
    ... the name of the method is getBrowserPermission (without
    Text)</a></p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> We should also return a
    list of possible actions, such as "accept for session" in
    addition to just "accept" and "dismiss".</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Yes, I can add that. I
    like it.</p>

    <p class="phone"><a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/46#issuecomment-281253274"><strong class="resolution" id="resolution03">RESOLUTION: add "actions", which must include "accept" and "dismiss", and possibly other actions as available</strong></a></p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> We need to come of with
    names for these.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> This is also something
    you'd want to handled declaratively.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> That worries me<br>
    ... I think the default one should not be "dismiss"
    temporarily, it should be "deny"</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mike:</b> This should be for the
    session, right?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> With webdriver, the
    install are just for the session anyway.</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>mikepie</b>&gt; mandatory: accept;
    deny (for session? permanent?)</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Session and permanent is
    the same, since the extension is only installed for the
    session.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Right, but deny and
    dismiss are different</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> Correct, and we should go with deny
    rather than dismiss as the mandatory one</p>

    <p class="phone"><a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/46#issuecomment-281253274"><strong class="resolution" id="resolution04">RESOLUTION: replace dismiss with deny</strong></a></p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Do we need to come up
    with names?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Since there's no
    difference between permanent and for this session only, allow,
    deny and dismiss are all we need.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> So we only have 2
    possible cases at install time, and 3 at run time</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> At install time, the only
    choise is really install extension or not.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I'll add a section to
    explain what kind of thing can appear there.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> If there can be other
    names, do we need to standardize?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>all:</b> Yes, but not now.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> mikepie, you can merge
    the PR once the changes are in.</p>

    <h3 id="item02">Next meeting</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> How about the Ides of
    March.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>all:</b> Agreed.</p>
