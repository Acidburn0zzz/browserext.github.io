    <h3 id="item01">WebIDL conventions</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> This link is what I plan to
    send<br>
    ... there's basicaly to options:<br>
    ... one use the CheckAnyPermissions attribute, and one that
    breaks it down and specifies it in words</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; The IDL looks
    good</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> I can walk you through
    this</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Please do</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> There's a top level
    interface call ExtensionGlobal<br>
    ... it has one property, "browser"<br>
    ... [... describes the content of the mail pasted above
    ...]</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I like this model a
    lot<br>
    ... it is a clean way to extend window.<br>
    ... I think it would help if you could expand a bit with examples, to make it easier to understand.</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; I agree a little
    more details would help for anyone on mailing list</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> It can work for dynamic
    capabilities, added during execution</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> That's the way it is done
    in webapps for the navigator property, saying this must only be
    exposed in certain contexts.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>andrey-r:</b> More details would be
    good, or people on the mailing list will have a hard time
    understanding.<br>
    ... but I like the proposal.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Where will you send it?
    both lists?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> I was thinking of the WebIDL mailing list, but I can CC the browserext CG.</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; Both list would be
    good</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Any thoughts about the
    events object?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> Would have to give a
    different name, "tabs" is a terrible name.<br>
    ... Maybe call it broadcaster or dispatcher or something?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> If we can move forward
    with this, I can use it to write up the draft,
    but there might be some push back, so don't want to rush into using
    it before we got feedback.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> The only push back could be
    about using attributes that aren't part of the spec</p>

    <h3 id="item02">Top level object name and protocol name</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I can go with "browser" or
    "navigator.extension", and prefer "browser", but Opera was
    preferring the other one.</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; I am ok with
    both</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> for the protocol,
    browser-extensions:// feels too long</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>mikepie</b>&gt; How about
    browser-ext:// ?</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; browser-ext:// -
    Yes</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> is browser:// too short
    for the protocol name?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Microsoft people
    expressed concern about extension:// for being to short / generic.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> browserext:// ?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> Happy eitherway</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I think browserext:// is
    good</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; agree</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> and just browser for the
    object?</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>mikepie</b>&gt; And browser.* for
    object</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Opera proposed "nex", do
    we want to to follow that?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> it does make sense, but
    I prefer what we just said</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>kmag:</b> I'd be ok for the top level
    object, not the protocol</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Seem there's no
    objection either way, and most people prefering browser & browserext://. Should we resolve on that?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Want to loop in Shwetank</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Sure. Resolutions during
    meeting are provisional anway.</p>

    <p class="phone"><strong class="resolution" id="resolution01"><a href="https://github.com/browserext/browserext/issues/2">RESOLUTION: use "browser" as the top level
		    object, and browserext:// as the protocol name</a></strong></p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Do we need to register
    that protocol?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> I can do
    that</p>

    <h3 id="item03">How to identify functions/properties/events
    under the objects we've identified</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> How do we do that?
    Should I prepare something for the next meeting?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Set it up as a github
    issue, and we discuss there, and take it by phone once it's settled down somewhat?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Sounds good.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Once we have that and
    the IDL, we can make a spec that looks like one</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Yes</p>

    <h3 id="item04">TPAC</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> What do we want to do
    there?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>andrey-r:</b> Meet :)</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> I've requested a time
    slot, on Thursday IIRC.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> First time for CGs to
    meet at TPAC right?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Yes</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Should we try and have a
    more complete spec to review?</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>andrey-r:</b> Yes, hard to be
    productive otherwise.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> Should native messaging
    be together?</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; Native messaging
    is very important topic</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> We can only book for the
    CG, not per topic, so it will have to be together anyway.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>andrey-r:</b> Is this going to be
    madness again, with stickers on the board?</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; Sorry</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Madness is the Wednesday
    "unconference". CG meetings are different, we should get a sane time slot.<br>
    ... I'll follow up</p>

    <p class="irc">&lt;<b>andrey-r</b>&gt; I was saying that
    I would prefer to meet as early as possible, but if thursday is
    best for most that's fine</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Houdini shows that you
    can have productive meetings for high level discussions, but in
    our case having concrete things to discuss would indeed be
    better, so let's try to have a draft spec.</p>

    <h3 id="item05">next meeting</h3>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> It would be good to have
    topics ahead of time, please file github issues or ML
    threads.</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>mikepie:</b> When do we meet next</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>andrey-r:</b> Anytime!</p>

    <p class="phone"><b>Florian:</b> Not next week, but
    anytime is generally OK.</p>
